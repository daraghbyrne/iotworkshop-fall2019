# III IoT Workshop 2019

An introduction to the internet of things and making a [Particle](http://particle.io) powered Ambient Orb

As part of this workshop you'll have a kit with

- A breadboard
- A Particle Argon
- A Micro USB Cable (use this to power the Argon)
- A 10K Potentiometer a.k.a. a dial
- 10K, 1K, 220Ohm Ohm Resistors
- A single 5mm LED (components that make light)
- An RGB LED (common anode) 
- A momentary push button
- A Photocell / photoresistor

By the end of this workshop you'll have built a simple internet controlled light using this components. It'll work like this:

- the pushbutton will let you turn the light on (displaying) and off (no lights).
- the potentiometer will work like a dial allowing you to select different colors
- in the background, the microcontroller will let you control these elements online
- while it's being controlled online, the LED will blink to let you know

### Step by Step

- Step 1: [Basic LED Circuit](/step1)
- Step 2: [Turn and LED on and Off with a pushbutton](/step2)
- Step 3: [Adding a Potentiometer and Fading the LED](/step3)
- Step 4: [Adding Internet - Seeing Values](/step4)

/- Step 5: [Controling Color](/step5)
/- Step 6: [Bitcoin Data](/step6)
/- Step 7: [Displaying Data](/step7)
/- Step 8: [Better Loading](/step8)
/- Step 9: [Adding Multiple Currencies](/step9)
/- Step 10: [On/Off](/step10)
/- Step 11: [Fine Tuning](/step11)

By the end of this you should have a working Particle Hue! This is only a starting point. With a little effort, you can easily modify this example to be an internet connected device that does a lot of different stuff. It could be adapted to be a weather display, a game, etc.
